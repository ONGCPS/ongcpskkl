Functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment. It implies that the system or equipment can be operated
 properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury.

Functional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence. In this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the European
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA ),[13] regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards. This is meant to reach and ensure the highest 
possible level of safety. The standards AS 9100 in America, EN 9100 on the European market or JISQ 9100 in Asia particularly address the aerospace and 
aviation industry. These are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles. Some companies are therefore specialized in the certification,
 inspection verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations.
